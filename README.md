## Which OS Is Best

During our normal working days, we highlight each instance where an operating system lets us down. Each time we encounter a situation, a tally is either added or removed from each operating system. Every time a tally is added or removed, we add an even and explanation to our tally log. 

Reviewing the tally log will highlight all the issues or grand features of each operating system
